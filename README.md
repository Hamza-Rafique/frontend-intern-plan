## Overview

This plan is organized into 12 weeks, each with specific learning objectives, activities, and resources to build your frontend skills. You will start with essential HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, then focus on React.js and its ecosystem. By the end of this internship, youâ€™ll be able to create and deploy fully functional frontend applications.

## Objectives

- Develop a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Learn and apply core concepts of React.js, including hooks, state management, and component-based architecture.
- Gain experience with tools and libraries commonly used with React (e.g., React Router, Axios, and testing frameworks).
- Build and deploy a complete frontend project.

## Weekly Breakdown

### **Phase 1: Foundations (Weeks 1-4)**
- **Week 1**: HTML & CSS Basics

  - JavaScript fundamentals: variables, functions, loops, and DOM manipulation.
  - Build interactive components with vanilla JavaScript.
- **Week 3**: Advanced JavaScript Concepts
  - Study ES6+ features, asynchronous programming, and basic API calls.
  - Practice using `fetch` to load data from a public API.
- **Week 4**: Git and Version Control

  - Build components that display dynamic data from external sources.
- **Week 10**: State Management with Context API
  - Learn Context API for global state management.
  - Use Context to manage application-wide states, like theme or user authentication.
- **Week 11**: Testing React Components
  - Introduction to testing in React using Jest and React Testing Library.
  - Write unit tests for components and understand test-driven development.
- **Week 12**: Final Project and Deployment
